# Automate-API by Abhishek Jain

## Project Overview

This project is an **Express.js API** built for a driver booking system. It provides endpoints to retrieve driver information and calculate fares based on routes, number of passengers, and other parameters. The API supports features like route validation, passenger count validation, night fares, hostel surcharges, and more.

### Features:
- **Driver Info**: Retrieve driver data (name, phone, and location).
- **Booking Service**: Calculate fares for a specific route with customizable options (e.g., number of passengers, night fare, hostel surcharge).
- **CORS Support**: The API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for handling requests from multiple domains.

## Error Codes and Responses

### Common Error Codes:

- **400 Bad Request**: The request is malformed or contains invalid data.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server while processing the request.

### Error Response Format:
```json
{
  "status": <status_code>,
  "message": "<error_message>",

}
```

---

## CORS Configuration

This API uses the `cors` middleware to enable **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**, allowing the API to accept requests from any origin.

By default, **all origins** are allowed:
```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: '*', // Allows all origins, modify as necessary
  })
);
```

---

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do's:
- Always provide valid and complete parameters in the request.
- Use proper HTTP status codes in responses (e.g., `200` for success, `400` for bad requests).
- Provide clear error messages to help users troubleshoot.

### Don'ts:
- Do not send incomplete requests (e.g., missing required parameters).
- Do not hardcode sensitive data or credentials in the code.
- Do not ignore error handling; always handle exceptions properly.
